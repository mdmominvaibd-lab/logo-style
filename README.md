A tiny demo that shows a logo style over a background image.

Background image (as provided):

Files added:

- `index.html` — small demo page that displays a logo over the background image.
- `styles.css` — styles for the logo and page, using the background image URL.

How to try locally

Open `index.html` in your browser. On most systems you can double-click the file or serve the directory with a simple static server.

Notes

- The demo uses the provided link directly as a CSS background-image URL. If you prefer to keep the image locally, download it and update `styles.css` to point to the local file.
- If the image URL changes or blocks hotlinking, replace it with another image or host it locally.
